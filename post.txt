**The problem** 
The image built on a ARM64 machine does not run on the same machine, a new Mac with an ARM64 processor.

Long description: I would like to build a two-dockers system for teaching networking protocols. One of them has to run Wireshark for packet capture and analysis. Some students have amd64, others have arm64. A docker-based lab is a solution, which is going to replace the previous VirtualBox based one. Note that the image built for a amd64 runs on a arm64 architecture, but packet capture does to work :-/ 

**To Reproduce**
1. git clone https://github.com/fcwu/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop.git
2. cd docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop
3. git submodule init; git submodule update
4. make extra-clean
5. ARCH=arm64 make build
6. make run

**Expected behavior**
At this point, the docker should become accessible using localhost:6080. Instead, the image does not boot, and this is the log:

```
% make run             
docker run --privileged --rm \
-p 6080:80 -p 6081:443 \
-v /Users/lucapagnesi/Documents/docker/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop:/src:ro \
-e USER=doro -e PASSWORD=mypassword \
-e ALSADEV=hw:2,0 \
-e SSL_PORT=443 \
-e RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=approot \
-e OPENBOX_ARGS="--startup /usr/bin/galculator" \
-v /Users/lucapagnesi/Documents/docker/docker-ubuntu-vnc-desktop/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl \
--device /dev/snd \
--name ubuntu-desktop-lxde-test \
dorowu/ubuntu-desktop-lxde-vnc:latest
* enable custom user: doro

qemu-x86_64: Could not open '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory
make: *** [run] Error 255
```
The operating system on the host machine is MacOS.
